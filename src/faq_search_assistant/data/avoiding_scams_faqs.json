    "question": "What are the warning signs for scams related to People's Postcode Lottery?",
    "answer": "You cannot win a lottery unless you have entered. Legitimate lotteries, including People's Postcode Lottery, never ask you to pay taxes, fees, insurance, shipping, or handling charges before receiving a prize. Scammers often ask for money upfront via money transfer. If you are unsure about any communication, call 0808 109 8765 or email info@postcodelottery.co.uk.",

    "question": "How can I spot fraudulent communications claiming to be from People's Postcode Lottery?",
    "answer": "Legitimate lotteries will never ask you to pay to receive winnings or to keep a win secret. You cannot win if you haven't bought a ticket. Even if an email or letter appears to come from a known company, contact them via another method to confirm authenticity. Scammers may also use spoofing to mimic People's Postcode Lottery phone numbers.",
