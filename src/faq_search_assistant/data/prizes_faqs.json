    "question": "What does my ticket play for?",
    "answer": "Your ticket plays for prizes every day of the week. Every day, players in 20 postcodes each win £1,000 per ticket. Every Saturday, players in one postcode win a share of £1 Million in our Millionaire Street prize. Every month, players could also win £250,000 for every ticket in one winning postcode, or one lucky postcode sector wins a share of our Postcode Millions prize. On rare occasions, if there are not enough winning tickets in a postcode sector, the area may be expanded to the postcode district. See our How It Works page for more details."
